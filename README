Slidifier lets you easily turn your notes into a beautiful presentation. 

Imagine this: you have spent the evening reading up on some new material, and have taken notes tirelessly during this. Then you realize that it is already way past midnight, and you just want to go to sleep. But wait, don't you have to spend the next two hours creating a powerpoint presentation based on your notes? Well, no, you don't! Slidifier comes to the resque!

Or imagine this: have you ever tried to include code in a powerpoint presentation? Well, we rest our case, slidifier sucks an order of magnitude less than powerpoint when it comes to code!

NOTE: slidifier is kinda in a BETA condition as of now, but we will refine it (we promise!)

Happy slidifying!
